To this day, small and medium businesses continue using traditional manual systems like handwritten bookkeeping records, resulting in stock mismanagement and financial losses by allowing human errors to occur. With The Shop Management System, businesses can track their inventory in a less time-consuming and much more accurate way. The Shop Management System is a Python-based database-driven application that enables storekeepers to optimize inventory management and sales tasks. This digital framework structures a solution with features that help users maintain inventory data, handle transaction records and item tracking, and provide stock evaluation alongside sales reporting. SQLite database offers businesses both accurate data storage and retrieval capabilities, which allows them to make data-driven decisions through their stored information.



General Project Description

The shop management system aims to provide an accurate, less stressful, and sustainable solution for shop management: record tracking, sales, stock levels, reports, and general inventory by automating the management system, boosting overall efficiency.

Python Functions and Features include:


1. General Inventory Management:

View_item: Displays a list of all items 
Add_item: Adds a new item to the inventory
Update_item: This modifies and makes edits to existing inventory, including current pricing and price margin
Delete_item: Removes an inventory if it is no longer needed.

2. Sales Management: 

Record_sale: Records sold items, price, and quantity.
View_sales_report: Generate a summary of all transactions within a specified period.

3. Data Integration: The notebooks have rows and columns that store all the shop information and sales records. Our Shop Inventory System uses a small, lightweight digital filing system (SQLite) where all inventories are saved. It allows the storekeeper to implement  Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data effectively. 

4. Accuracy and Security: The database is secure and ensures no information and inventory is lost. It implements validation checks before and after modifications. By incorporating these validation checks, Our Shop Management System will streamline operations and ensure better decision-making for storekeepers.
